Servings: 3-4

### Ingredients:

- 2T canola, vegetable or coconut oil
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 1 inch ginger, minced
- 1 tsp mild curry powder
- 1lb carrots (about 1 bunch), peeled, cut into 1-1½ inch pieces
- 1 medium sweet potato, cut into ¾ to 1 inch pieces
- 2C low sodium chicken or vegetable broth (for vegan)
- 1C coconut milk
- Zest of 1 lime
- Kosher salt and fresh cracked pepper
- Parsley or cilantro leaves, for garnish
- Lime wedges, for serving

### Directions:

Warm oil in a medium-sized pot over medium heat. Add onion, carrots, potato and curry powder, and season with salt and pepper. Sauté for 4-5 minutes or until vegetables start to soften, but do not brown. Add ginger and sauté 1 minute.

Stir in broth and coconut milk (it should be enough to cover the carrots). Cover, bring to a boil, and reduce to a simmer. Cook, partially covered, for 15-20 minutes or until vegetables are very tender. Puree in a blender until smooth. Stir in lime zest. Taste and adjust seasoning, if needed. Add additional broth or coconut milk to thin the soup, if desired. Garnish with parsley and serve with lime wedges. Enjoy.
