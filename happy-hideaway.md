# Happy Hideaway 

Once in a while a new artist, album or song surprises us on occassion. We are reminded of the better parts from our past. Now and finally, the anomaly catches up to us in this timeline. _Violent Rains_ by Minuit Machine is one of those unwrapped rarities. From the initial start of pressing play, the takeback feeling is hard to ignore the early days of Xymox. Imagine if Anka Wolbert released a solo album in the 90s and we just pulled back the curtain today. Minuit Machine is reminiscent of a wonderful sadness, redefining the 4AD era of yesteryear. Although, at first listen, itâ€™s bound to add some tickles to any still-open wounds and leave you with a cozy heart.
